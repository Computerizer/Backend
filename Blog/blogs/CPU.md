# CPU Guide 2023

In the last article we spoke on how each part of the computer is important, and what role it plays in delivering a pleasant experience. We haven’t mentioned any names though… so in our 2nd article of “PC Building Zero 2 Hero”, we will suggest the Best PC parts given all the different categories, this time… the CPU. So stay tuned!

## CPU
As discussed in the previous article, your choice is between AMD or Intel, and this choice will determine all the other parts of your build. The hype AMD has built in the past few years has been quite huge, and it’s definitely for a reason. The actual performance difference between Ryzen and Intel Core has become pretty negligible now, as the core counts and clock speeds are extremely similar. However, we still recommend going with AMD Ryzen for the following reasons:

•	Backwards Compatibility 
•	Decent out of the Box Cooler
•	Wider Overclocking options 
•	Better performance per dollar 

## Compatibility 
Currently, all of AMD’s CPUs are compatible with the AM4 socket. Which is great for both compatibility and options, as you can use a brand new Ryzen 5000 CPU with and older X470 motherboard, just with a BIOS update! Meanwhile, Intel is always likely to have a socket change for their next-gen CPUs, so you won’t have the luxury of backwards compatibility.

## Intel vs AMD stock cooler
If anyone has ever built a PC or heard about PC building, he probably already knows the answer. However, we will compare both stock cooler based on our benchmarks and the cooler’s specs.
First of all, AMD guarantees you a stock cooler shipped with your Ryzen CPU, unlike Intel that doesn’t ship coolers with all its CPU models. AMD also has a wide range of coolers that get better with the higher end CPUs, starting with the wraith stealth, up to the wraith prism. Meanwhile, Intel has a similar stock cooler for all it’s lineup with negligible differences.
The biggest downside for Intel’s stock coolers is that some models come with an Aluminum Core, unlike AMD’s Copper Core. Copper conducts heat better than Aluminum, and it also has lower Specific Heat Capacity than Aluminum. Meaning that a Copper Core will transfer heat better in a CPU cooler, which already indicates that AMD’s stock coolers will perform better. AMD’s higher end Wraith Prism and Max coolers come with extra heat pipes as well.
AMD stock coolers aren’t only technically better, but they’re aestically better as well! The base AMD stock cooler (Wraith stealth) is all black with black cables, unlike Intel’s blue and mustard cables. AMD’s higher end stock cooler (Wraith Prism) even comes with RGB lights, if you’re into that… 
Our Benchmark Below shows the CPU’s temperature with each Stock Cooler. (CPU used: Ryzen 5 3600)

## Intel vs AMD (Overclocking potential)
The way Intel labels its CPUs is a bit trickier than AMD.
AMD labels its CPUs as follows: (CPU name) (Model). So it would be something like: Ryzen 5 3600 or Ryzen 5 3600x.  
Intel however follows a different naming scheme, placing either K, F, or KF after the CPU name (only applies for consumer desktop and not laptops). For example, Intel Core i5 11600-K. Each letter or pair of letters represent something different about the CPU, and it goes as follows:
K: means that the CPU has full overclocking potential 
F: means that the CPU requires a discrete graphics card
KF: supports overclocking, but requires a discrete graphics card.
This basically means that not all Intel CPU models support Overclocking, meanwhile all AMD CPU models support Overclocking. Another win for AMD’s side is the motherboards’ overclocking potential, as both the -mid tier- B and -high end- X series motherboards support overclocking. For Intel, only their high end Z series motherboard support overclocking.

Intel vs AMD (Value for money)
In order to do this comparison, we will use similar CPUs from both Intel and AMD, in this case the Ryzen 7 5800x and Core i7 11700K. Both Processors are quite similar, but we will discuss the small differences to know which one is worth it.
The Ryzen 7 5800x has a faster base speed of 3.8Ghz, as well as being much more efficient with 105W of power needed. The Ryzen 7 5800x also has newer chip with 7nm technology.
The Core i7 11700K has better overclocking potential with a max of 5.0Ghz, as well as slightly better single-core and multi-core speeds.
Basically, the Intel Core i7 11700K is considered better value, due to the slightly better speed and slightly lower price. However, if we consider motherboards, it’s a different story. 
You can fully function the Ryzen 7 5800x on a B550 motherboard that costs 120$, no real need for a X570 motherboard. Meanwhile, in order to get the most out of your Core i7 11700K, or even do any overclocking, you must get a Z590 motherboard that costs a $160.
Good news is… you don’t need either a Ryzen 7 5800x or Core i7 11700K. We believe that best value CPU in the market right now is the Ryzen 5 5600x, being more than 100$ cheaper than both the 5800x and 11700K.
The Ryzen 5 5600x is a truly great CPU, you can buy it now right here! Good luck with you next build… and Stay tuned for our next article!
