# Improve your setup with these 3 steps!
The road to the ultimate setup is still far away, and you have probably already spent a lot of time working on it. Many people have even stopped upgrading their setups due to how frustrating it is.   But this ends now! In this article we will help you reach your ultimate setup; it only takes 3 steps.    We will focus on aesthetic and visual improvements for now, so stay tuned!

## STEP 1: CABLE MANAGEMENT
This has to be the hardest part to fix in any setup. Whether your setup is difficult to cable manage or you being lazy, we’ve got you covered! We will not discuss difficult and time consuming methods like routing your cables through the wall, but instead focus on easy, fast, and cheap methods of cable managing your setup.
Cable sleeves
Cable sleeves have to be one of the fastest and cheapest methods of cable managing your setup.       It basically combines all your cables into one “sleeve”, acting as one big cable. Not only do they hide all your cables, but they look good as well! You can get a pack of cable sleeves for as low as 10$ from amazon (check it out here)

### Under desk trays 
Perhaps the most famous one is the IKEA Signum rack, but all other kinds serve the same purpose. Under desk trays are the best solution for a lazy cable management setup, and it does a decent job as well! You just screw it under your desk and rest your cables on it. So if you’re short on time, you can get one for as low as 15$ on amazon (check it out here).


### Cable clips
This is our favorite! Although they take the longest to setup, it’s 100% worth it. They come in all shapes, sizes, and forms. You can get ones that stick using 3M tape, but we suggest getting the ones that screw in as they are much sturdier. You simply put your cables inside the “clip”, and screw it in wherever you want (under or behind the table). You can even get ones that stick over you table, which is useful for managing the cables of your keyboard and mouse. 

## Step 2: Monitor mounting
Before reading the step, make sure your monitor is VESA compatible. You can do this by looking at the back of your monitor and checking if 4 screw places in square are available, or just check on the manufacturer’s website. Once you have made sure your monitor is VESA compatible, you can continue reading.
There are 2 types of monitor mounting: Desk mounting and Wall mounting. If you frequently change the position of your setup, then go for desk mounting. Otherwise go for wall mounting, as it saves you even more space on your desk. 
The general benefits of mounting your monitor are amazing. Monitor mounting will give you extra desk space to work with, which is really helpful especially for those who have monitors with huge bases. Monitor mounting is also aesthetically pleasing, as it gives your setup a cleaner look overall.
Before buying one, make sure the specific mount you want supports your screen size, as some mounts don’t support over 27 inches. Monitor mounts that hook to the desk are called “monitor arms”, and they come in many shapes and forms. So choose one based on what your needs are. 
You can get monitor mounts for as low as 25$, but going a little bit higher would be better.              We suggest the ErGear Monitor Mount on amazon (Check it out here).

## STEP 3: RGB !!!
We know you’ve been waiting for it…it’s finally time! But let’s not get crazy. A huge and widespread problem is people using RGB carelessly and without thinking. In order to get the most out of your RGB, and have it be aesthetically pleasing, you need to keep in mind several stuff…
Firstly, follow a color scheme. Following a certain color scheme will give your setup a synchronized theme, as well as giving it character. It may be difficult to find the perfect color combo, but it’s okay… Experiment with different colors that your personally connect with, until you find the right combo!
Now…this is very important, ALWAYS DIFFUSE your RGB strips! Many people sadly use RGB strips in the open air with no covering or diffusion whatsoever, and it looks ugly. Diffusion simply helps in spreading out the light evenly, preventing hotspots. RGB channels and diffusers can be found all over amazon; so if you have RGB strips, get some now! (Check it out here) 
Finally comes budget! The thing with RGB is…you can make it look good no matter your budget. If your budget is tight, diffused RGB strips are amazing. If you have a little bit more budget though,  then RGB panels it is! The best 2 RGB light panels are the Cololights and Nanoleafs. The best part about RGB panels is the endless customization, not to mention how the panels can sync with your music, connect to your phone, and so on. (Check them out here)
